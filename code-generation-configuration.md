# Code Generation Configuration

Please refer to Chapter 3 of <a href="/documentation/pdf/springfuse.pdf">SpringFuse Reference Documentation</a>								

The Celerio code generation configuration file is located here: 

	yourproject/src/main/config/maven-celerio-plugin/maven-celerio-plugin.xml

<p class="tip"> 
	A thorough configuration file example is provided when you generate a project out of the sample H2 database that we provide.
</p>

The configuration allows you to:

* change the generated property names, 
* make certain association bidirectional, 
* map a column to an enum, 
* use Joda Time, 
* etc.
