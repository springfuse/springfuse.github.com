# Zenika announces a major Java JEE conference in Paris
Hello, 

Our friends from <a href="http:/www.zenika.com">Zenika</a> have recently announced that they are organizing a new major Java event in Europe... 

I am glad for two reasons:
 
* it's Zenika, and we love them at Jaxio
* but also because it is going to be in Paris... 

Check their site <a href="http://www.whatsnextparis.com/">http://www.whatsnextparis.com/</a> and register asap. 

Yes Paris could become the Java capital in Europe ! 

Go go Zenika.
