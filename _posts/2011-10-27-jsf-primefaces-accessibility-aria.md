# Generate Accessible Rich Internet Application using JSF2 and PrimeFaces

We are trying to make the web applications generated by SpringFuse as accessible as possible.

## Online code checker
Our first goal was to pass online code checkers such as <a href="http://achecker.ca/">achecker</a>. 

All the generated pages pass the  WCAG 2.0 (Level AAA) with <strong>0 known problems</strong> and <strong>0 likely problems</strong>.

<a href="/images/blog/2011-10-27/achecker.png" class="screen" title="achecker result" rel="group"><img src="/images/blog/2011-10-27/achecker-min.png" /></a>

Achieving it is not really complicated, the key is to use standard HTML components. 

Hopefully, PrimeFaces the JSF 2 component library we use is pretty clean in that respect.

## keyboard

Our next focus was to unplug our mouse to ensure our generated application is entirely usable with the keyboad only.

The result is pretty good with all major browsers except with IE8 which randomly select the default submit button when the user presses enter.

If you have any hints on how we could fix it, please drop us a line.

## Screen readers and Aria

Then we started to support ARIA and specially ARIA live region.

For the screencast, we use Mac OSX Lion, which ship with new version of VoiceOver (a screen reader) with a nice French voice (sorry for the accent :-)

VoiceOver reads region that are updated after a user interaction such as pressing a button which trigger an ajax request and refresh a part of the screen (the live region)

The generated app uses live regions for two main purposes:

* to announce the number of items found on each search pages [<a href="/images/blog/2011-10-27/search-aria-live-region-voiceover.png" class="screen" title="achecker result" rel="group">photo</a>
 | <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10150355167495905&set=vb.307765762572284&type=2&theater" target="_jaxio_on_fb" >screencast</a>]
* to announce the error detected after a form submission [<a href="/images/blog/2011-10-27/form-error-aria-live-region-voiceover.png" class="screen" title="achecker result" rel="group">photo</a>
 | <a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?v=10150355172465905&set=vb.307765762572284&type=2&theater" target="_jaxio_on_fb">screencast</a>]


Issue with numbers:

* You probably noticed that it does not read 2 digits numbers properly. When it encounters '48', instead of saying 'quarante-huit' (forty eight), it says 'quatre' (four) then 'huit' (eight). If you know how to fix that, we are interested. 


## More tests...

We encourage you to <a href="http://www.springfuse.com/">generate a webapp</a> and try it for yourself.
Your feedbacks, specially test results using screen readers would be greatly appreciated.
