# Springfuse announces early Primefaces 3 support
 
We are pleased to announce that we have successfully migrated the code that SpringFuse generates from PrimeFaces 2.2.1 to PrimeFaces 3.0.RC1-SNAPSHOT

Primefaces 3 is still in development, but the 3.0 release should arrive soon.

Progressively we will make sure we use the best of the new components. 

Here is a screenshot of our classic Account entity edit flow (generated by SpringFuse from our database schema example)
