# Flex and Spring integration using Blazeds and SpringFuse

Hello, 

here is a nice article about <a href="http://contextuel.net/archives/12">adding BlazeDS support to SpringFuse</a> generated project. 

The target audience is people that want to implement a Java based back-end for a Flex web application 
but are novice to Spring and Hibernate. 

Enjoy !

Nicolas.
