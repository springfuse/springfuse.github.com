## Switching to Celerio 4

We are pleased to announce that Celerio (the code generator that was powering SpringFuse) is now freely available
and that Celerio Code generation templates are Open Source.

** To start using Celerio, please follow [Celerio's documentation](http://www.jaxio.com/documentation/celerio/) **

Code generation templates source code are here...

* backend templates: [https://github.com/jaxio/pack-backend-jpa](https://github.com/jaxio/pack-backend-jpa)
* frontend templates: [https://github.com/jaxio/pack-jsf2-spring-conversation](https://github.com/jaxio/pack-jsf2-spring-conversation)

We are going to release more template packs in the coming weeks...


Happy coding with Celerio!

The Jaxio team.
