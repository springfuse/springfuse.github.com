## Switching to Celerio 4

We are pleased to announce that Celerio (the code generator that was powering SpringFuse) is now Open Source.

If you already have Maven 3.1.1 (or above) and Java 1.8 installed, to generate a sample project, simply run:

	mvn com.jaxio.celerio:bootstrap-maven-plugin:4.0.10:bootstrap
    
For more information please visit [Jaxio's site](http://www.jaxio.com/en/)

Happy coding with Celerio!

The Jaxio team.
