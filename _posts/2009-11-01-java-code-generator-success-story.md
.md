# Java Code Generator Success Story

Earlier this year, a software development team working at <a href="http://www.steria.com/en/about-steria.htm">Steria</a>, a leading IT consulting firm in Europe, 
has invited <a href="http://www.jaxio.com/">Jaxio</a> to demonstrate Celerio, the Enterprise version of SpringFuse.

During our presentation of Celerio, we realized that the development team had already bootstrapped a major project for a bank with the Java source code generated by SpringFuse.

Three days later Celerio was added to their build process.

We are happy to announce that 7 months later, Steria delivers on time the project <a href="http://www.bforbank.com/">BForBank</a>, the “first 100% online private bank from Credit Agricole”.

The launch of BforBank has been extensively covered by the media in France: press articles and even a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXaNshvFBD8&feature=player_embedded">TV ad</a>.

Steria and Jaxio are going to present this success story at the <a href="http://www.mdday.fr/">Model Driven Day</a> conference in Paris on November 26th. 

We hope to meet you there!
