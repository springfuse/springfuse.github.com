# Introducing JPA in the code generated by SpringFuse

In version 2.8.9, we are introducing JPA in the code generated by <a href="http://www.springfuse.com">SpringFuse</a>. I
t was the most demanded feature from our users.

The beans of the generated domain layer now use JPA annotations. 
Since we wanted to keep all the features we had in previous version of <a href="http://www.springfuse.com">SpringFuse</a>, 
there are still some Hibernate dependencies in the generated code. For example we use the Criteria API in the generated DAO layer. 
We also use some specific Hibernate annotations at the bean level, for example to configure the second level cache.

We think this is not a problem. When JPA 2.0 will be out we might reduce the number of hibernate dependencies. 
However, this is not our priority.

Another important change in the generated code is the use of <b>Generics</b>. 
We have factorized most of the DAO and manager code implementations/interfaces in base classes/interfaces using generic types.

We encourage you to generate or regenerate a project with the latest version of SpringFuse to benefit from the JPA support.
