Code modification, regeneration and collisions
==============================================

Introduction
------------

One of the most important feature of a code generator is its ability to
preserve manual code modifications across re-generations. To solve this
challenge, Celerio proposes various pragmatic solutions depending on the
nature of the generated file.

Java files
----------

By default, Celerio generates the main Java file under the directory
`src/main/generated-java` .

In this section you will learn how to modify a generated Java file
without loosing your modifications. The first approach consists in
simply moving the file in a user reserved folder. The second approach
involves inheritance of a base class. Both approaches have pros and
cons.

> **Important**

> In any case, you should never modify directly the generated Java file
> as you will loose your changes as soon as you regenerate the code.

### Code modifications through reserved folders

Before modifying the generated Java file, move it to the `src/main/java`
folder. For example, if you want to edit the generated
`BankAccount.java` file, move it from
`src/main/generated-java/<package path>/BankAccount.java` to
`src/main/java/<package path>/BankAccount.java`

> **Note**
>
> When you copy the file make sure you preserve the package directory
> structure.

Since all files under the `src/main/java` are considered as user
reserved files, Celerio will not interfere with them. Next time you run
Celerio, Celerio will detect the presence of BankAccount.java under
`src/main/java/<package path>` , leave it untouched, and will not
generate it here.

The main advantage of this approach is that, you now can do whatever you
want with the file, in particular you can modify any method's body etc.

The main drawback may show up if your database schema changes. You may
have to reflect those changes in the file that you now own as a regular
file. Hopefully, to help you in this task, Celerio generates the file in
a dedicated collision folder under the `target` folder. Please refer to
? .

### Code modifications through 'Base' inheritance

Celerio enables you to extend a generated Java class without modifying
the generated Java code or the generated resources files.

Let’s take an example with the `Account` class which maps the `Account`
table of your database schema.

Let's assume the `Account` source file is located at
`src/main/generated-java/com/example/demo/domain/Account.java` It looks
like this:

{% highlight java %}
package com.example.demo.domain;
@Entity
@Table(name = "ACCOUNT")
public class Account implements Serializable {
    //...   
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    //... skipped for clarity
}
{% endhighlight %}

Let’s assume from a JSP you want to display, using a single method call,
the full name of the user. One solution would be to add the following
method to the Account class:

{% highlight java %}
public String getFullName() {
        return getFirstName()+ " " + getLastName();
    }
{% endhighlight %}

Instead of adding this method in the generated file, where it would be
mixed with generated code, Celerio supports a cleaner solution that
enables you to extend the generated class of you choice and at the same
time preserve the same class name!

This technique has two major benefits:

No need to modify the existing files (Java, xml, etc.) that reference
the Java class that you want to extend.

The hand written code is isolated in a separated class, in a separated
file, which greatly improves the clarity of your code.

Best way to understand how it works is to try it:

Create a new `Account.java` file and save it in the directory:
`src/main/java/com/example/demo/domain`

Add this file under source control

> **Note**
>
> Note that the new path is almost the same as the old path. The only
> difference is that the file is now under `src/main/java` and not
> `generated-java` .

Open the newly created `Account.java` file and copy paste the following
code:

{% highlight java %}
package com.example.demo.domain;

@Entity
@Table(name = "ACCOUNT")
public class Account extends AccountBase implements Serializable {
    public String getFullName() {
        return getFirstName()+ " " + getLastName();
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

This `Account` class now extends a class that does not exist yet!

Next time you run Celerio, it will detect your new `Account.java` file
and will also detect that the `Account` class extends a class that has
the same name plus the `Base` suffix.

This is enough for Celerio to assume that you want to impersonate the
class, and that it should generate the code corresponding to Account
table in a class called `AccountBase` instead of a class called
`Account` .

The source code of `AccountBase` is generated in the file
`src/main/generated-java/com/example/demo/domain/AccountBase.java` .
Since this class is an entity, the class level annotations that were
present on the original Account class must copied to your own Account
class. Hopefully if you read the source code of the 'Base' class, you
will find these annotations. Here is how a snapshot of the generated
AccountBase code.

{% highlight java %}
@MappedSuperclass
/* Copy paste these annotations as is in your subclass
@Entity
@Table(name = "ACCOUNT")
*/
public abstract class AccountBase implements Serializable {
    // code skipped for concision
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can notice the `@MappedSuperclass` is properly generated and the
other annotations are commented. Also the base class is made abstract to
prevent you from instanciating it .

> **Note**
>
> Always check the source code of the 'Base' class, you may find some
> instructions related to some annotations that must be added to your
> class.

During the generation process, if Celerio encounters the old file

`src/main/generated-java/com/example/demo/domain/Account.java` file, it
deletes it to prevent class duplication.

You can proceed by analogy to override other Java classes.

Other files (non-Java)
----------------------

### Code modifications through reserved folders

Ideally all generated files should be under a `generated` folder. In
practice, this is not really convenient or possible as certain files are
expected to be in a well known location (ex: `web.xml` )

Whenever possible and pertinent, we keep the generated by under a
generated folder. This is specially useful for entity bound files as
there could be a lot of them.

This strategy is currently used for localization properties files. The
two folders are: `src/main/resources/localization/domain` and
`src/main/resources/localization/domain-generated` . The Spring's
`messageSource` configuration allow us to first lookup resources first
in the domain folder and then in the domain-generated folder. This
simple fact allows you to change a property key without modifying any
generated file under `domain-generated` . You just have to create a
properties file under the `domain` folder and 'override' your properties
here. Do not forget to configure the message source to take your new
file into account though.

The same applies for generated Spring Web Flow xhtml files, they are
generated under `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/flows-generated` but by
configuration, Spring Web Flow will first look up a flow by id in the
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/flows` user's reserved folder. So, do not
modify the generated flows, instead simply copy the files you need under
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/flows` and then modify the copied version.

### Code modification through source control

#### Overwrite non-java generated file with your own content

To overwrite the content of the non-java generated file with your own
content, first add add this file to your your source control system and
then modify it as you want.

Next time Celerio runs, it will detect that this file is under source
control and will not overwrite it.

In a sense, the generated code is frozen for this file: Celerio does not
control it anymore, it is under your control.

Since you may need to have access to the orignal generated file for
merging purposes, Celerio still generates it, but under the `target`
folder. Please refer to ? .

If you change your mind and want Celerio to generate the file again,
simply remove the file from your source control and regenerate your
code.

#### Generation rule summary for non-java file

Before generating a non-java file, Celerio applies the following rules:

<table class="table">
	<tr>
		<th>File is already present on disk</th>
		<th>File is the same </th>
		<th>File is under source control</th>
		<th>Celerio action</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>No</td>
		<td>n/a</td>
		<td>n/a</td>
		<td>File is generated</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes or No</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>File is not generated</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>No</td>
		<td>File is generated in the collision directory</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Yes</td>
		<td>No</td>
		<td>No</td>
		<td>File is overwritten</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Collisions and Merging
----------------------

### Collision folder

When Celerio detects that a file which should be generated is already
present and under source control, it does not overwrite your file.

When it can, it merges the file or apply some advance rules. When it
cannot resolve the conflicts Celerio generates the files in conflict in
the collision folder: `target/maven-celerio-plugin/collisions`

All files generated in that folder have the same path as if they had
been generated normally, except for the
`target/maven-celerio-plugin/collisions` path prefix.

So, whenever appropriate, Celerio generates the original file, under the
expected path, in the collision folder
`target/maven-celerio-plugin/collisions`

### Merging manually the files

To merge the files in conflict, you can use a tool such as WinMerge.

Since, the files that led to some conflict are located in the collision
folder under the same relative path, you can use the recursive directory
comparison feature.

To do so, you just have to specify in WinMerge, your project root
directory and the collision directory

Then, you can keep track of changes you made and eventually merge some
of the newly generated code into your existing file.
