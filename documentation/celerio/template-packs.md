Template packs
==============

A template pack is a simple jar file provided by Jaxio that contains
generation templates. To be executed by Celerio, the jar file must be
explicitly added as a Celerio's dependency when running Celerio. Jaxio
provides various template packs with Celerio. New template packs can be
written either by Jaxio's consultants or Celerio's end users.
