title: Where to start guide 
---

You have tried the <a href="/app/quickstart">quickstart</a>
but you are overwhelmed by all the technologies used in the generated code
and you wonder where to start looking? This small guide is for you.

# There is no magic

There is no magic, you will have to learn and understand all the technologies used by the generated source code
to fully benefit from SpringFuse. There are 2 good news though:
* These technologies are highly demanded by the industry, you won't loose your time.
* The code generated by SpringFuse can be seen as a real application example, you can learn faster by studying it, running it and modifying it

# How come it runs?

You have no database, no web server installed on your computer and you are able to run
the project from the tutorial! How can this project run?


The generated project uses Maven2 to compile and to run the web application.
The <code>pom.xml</code> at the root of the project is for Maven what <code>build.xml</code>
is for Ant or what a <code>Makefile</code> is for gcc.

## Jetty starts a web server

There are hundreds of Maven plugins that can be added to your build process. One of them is the
Jetty plugin. The jetty plugin starts an http server, a servlet container and run
the generated project. It knows where are the JSP, the configurations files, the java classes etc.
because the generated code follows Maven's project structure conventions.
For example to start the web application it uses the file <code>src/main/web/WEB-INF/web.xml</code>

## H2 Database for the tutorial

The tutorial uses the H2 database to keep things simpler. Thanks to H2, there is no need
to install any database server. Please refer to <a href="http://www.h2database.com/html/quickstart.html">H2 quickstart
guide</a> to know more about H2 database. During development it can be pretty convenient to work with H2 and to switch to
a 'real' database later.

# Maven 2

Thanks to Maven 2 and the <code>pom.xml</code> file at the root of your project, all the jar dependencies are automatically downloaded from
Maven central repository.


Maven is a bit cumbersome at first. It takes time to get into it, so for the moment we recommend you to do not spend too much time
on it. It works, you can learn it later. If you are really impatient, then check these
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/articles.html">Maven resources</a>.

# The Spring Framework

The generated code heavily relies on the Spring Framework which
is a really powerful framework. This framework allows to instanciate beans
(i.e. components) and resolve their dependencies using an Inversion of Control design pattern.

## Inversion of Control

You may want to read a little bit about Spring before getting into the code.
Check the Spring Reference Documentation (you may start with
<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html">Chapter 3. The IoC container</a>)


You should also know that Spring uses Java annotations to simplify
the configuration. An annotation in Java start with the <code>@</code> character.


For example, you can declare beans using an annotation such
as <code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Service.html">@Service</a></code>, 
<code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Repository.html">@Repository</a></code> 
or even <code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html">@Controller</a></code>
and tell Spring to resolve the various dependencies thanks to the
<code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html">@Autowired</a></code> annotation.


You can search these annotations in the generated code to understand how it works and how
simple it is compare to verbose configuration files.



Once you have scratched the surface and you get the concept, you should
watch this video <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/johnson-configuring-spring">on configuring Spring</a>.
Do not resign yet, it takes time to digest Spring and to see the light. It is normal if you suffer here.


Take the time you need to understand how Spring wires together all the various 'beans'.


## Spring MVC

SpringFuse generates some code that uses the Spring Web MVC framework. Check
<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html">Chapter 15. Web MVC framework</a>. 
You can also check the Spring Web MVC configuration files
which are under <code>src/main/resources/spring</code>
and also the famous <code>src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml</code> file.
Search the generated code for the various generated controller under
<code>&lt;root package&gt;/web/controller/</code>, they use the <code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/stereotype/Controller.html">@Controller</a></code>,
<code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/RequestMapping.html">@RequestMapping</a></code>, etc. annotations.


## Declarative Transaction Management

The generated code uses the <code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html">@Transactional</a></code> annotation to demarc transaction boundaries. 
There is a lot of magic behind it and even if at the beginning you can take it for granted, it is important to understand the ins-and-outs.
It illustrates how Spring can provide a simple and elegant solution that addresses a complex problem.


Declarative transaction management is possible thanks to the use of AOP.
You may check the Spring Reference documentation about AOP 
(<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/aop.html">Chapter 7.
Aspect Oriented Programming with Spring</a>) but it is a little bit complex.


To know more about transaction management you should watch this great presentation:
<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/transaction-management-strategies">Transaction Management Strategies in Mission Critical Applications</a>.
Do not be scared by the title. Juergen Hoeller, one of the Spring Framework founders, is pretty pedagogic.
The video last 1h30 and worth gold. You should take the time to watch it and understand some of the concepts Juergen covers.
Listen carefully to the part that starts around 00:13:45 (hour:minutes:seconds) about Transaction Demarcation,
pay attention to what he says about the read-only flag around 00:25:00. He mention the <code><a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/transaction/annotation/Transactional.html">@Transactional</a></code>
annotation around 00:35:35. Also around 00:43:20 he goes into pragmatic details that can help understand
what it really does when the JDBC transaction manager is used.


## Open Entity Manager In View

The generated code uses the Spring's
<a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/orm/jpa/support/OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter.html">
<code>OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter</code></a> that implements the <a href="http://www.hibernate.org/43.html">Open Session In View</a> pattern.
Take the time to understand it, it is closely related to transaction management in a web environment.

# JPA/Hibernate

The generated code uses JPA with the Hibernate provider. We have grouped together the Hibernate dependent code in the <code>&lt;root package&gt;/hibernate</code> package.
The code is relatively simple but keep in mind that Hibernate is complex. The Java classes that map the database tables are
in the <code>&lt;root package&gt;/domain</code> package. The Hibernate configuration files are in are the <code>src/main/resources/META-INF/</code> folder.
Take also a look at the <code>src/main/resources/spring/applicationContext-jpa.xml</code> configuration.
